#About Me

Hello again! Thanks for visiting my About Me section. I am a self-taught data guy who used Coursera and other free online learning resources to teach himself R, Python, and Data Viz whilst unemployed and volunteering at various research opportunities in the North-East of England. This led me to my first job in the private sector seven years ago and I have been a data guy in one form or another ever since. 

For the last three years I have been working for my own company **Musto Analytics** as a data contractor, loaning myself out to companies to solve their data and modelling problems. 

Alongside this work in the private sector I am also a part-time PhD candidate at the Department of Computing, at Goldsmiths, under the brilliant supervision of [Dr Daniel Stamate](https://www.gold.ac.uk/computing/people/d-stamate/), [Dr Ida Pu](https://www.gold.ac.uk/computing/people/i-pu/), and [Professor Daniel Stahl](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/daniel-stahl) of the Department of Biostatistics and Health Informatics at The Institute of Psychiatry, Kings College London.

My research specifically looks at using AI as a tool for predicting things related to dementia prognosis and diagnosis. For example, we are looking at how to predict who is likely to develop some form of dementia, what is the risk of developing dementia as a function of time and, once someone has dementia, what their prognosis will be moving forward. To this end, we have published three papers thus far, which built models aiming to answer these questions.

Alongside all of this (somehow!) I have also done a bit of lecturing. I taught machine learning theory and practicalities at Goldsmiths using a mixture of lectures and practical labs using Jupyter notebooks and SKLearn in Python.

I am also part of an excellent organisation called [Demon Network](https://demondementia.com/) which brings together expertise from the world of AI and clinical research in order to help solve the issue of dementia in various ways. My biggest contributions to this organisation has been with their imaging working group, run by the excellent [Dr Tim Rittman](https://www.neuroscience.cam.ac.uk/directory/profile.php?tr332) of The Department of Clinical Neurosciences at the University of Cambridge. With his help, I have led on the organisation of three conferences aimed at early career neuroimaging researchers which aimed to introduce concepts related to AI, neuroimaging, and dementia.

When I am not doing all of that, I like to go bouldering and do a bit of baking.

As you can tell, my work life has led me to work in a lot of different industries and settings, and I am pleased that I have received very positive feedback as a result of the work I have done. The full list of recommendations I have received can be found on my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/henry-musto-63352441/) but some highlights can be found [here](recommendations.md).
