#Recommendations

'Henry led the data mining year 3 computer science BSc / MSc module at Goldsmiths, University of London. Spring term, 2023. 

Henry's attitude towards teaching was exceptional as he effectively balanced the explanation of advanced technical concepts with the often challenging task of communicating them clearly to students. Another major bonus was Henry’s combined industry and research experience. As a teacher of final year students this was invaluable for guiding future steps in either the work place or academia. 

The lectures were very engaging even during the exposition of highly technical concepts, Henry had great rapport with the students, allowing questions at the right times to initiate interesting discussions. Furthermore, the pace of the lectures was appropriately adapted to the difficulty of topics

After finishing the module content early, he gave a fascinating review of his academic research, effectively relating it as much as possible to the course content. This was exceptional and clearly showing Henry’s ability to elevate the course past the learning objectives (that were certainly met nonetheless). I would certainly recommend this module and Henry as a lecturer to future students and institutions alike.' - [Benedict Grey - Former student at Goldsmiths](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benedict-grey-b9850a231/)

'I had the pleasure of working with Henry on the Ford account, collaborating on a complex attribution project. This was a very time pressured piece of work with several different teams to navigate and satisfy.
